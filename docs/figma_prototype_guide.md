# WanderPal Figma Prototype Guide

## Overview / 概述

This document provides guidance for creating the Figma prototype based on the design specifications and wireframes. The prototype should capture the healing/gentle aesthetic and intuitive user flow of the WanderPal app.

本文档提供基于设计规范和线框图创建Figma原型的指导。原型应体现WanderPal应用的疗愈/温柔审美和直观用户流程。

## Design System Setup / 设计系统设置

Start by creating a comprehensive design system in Figma:

1. **Color Styles**
   - Primary: Soft blue/teal (#5BBFBA)
   - Secondary: Warm sand (#F5E2C8)
   - Accent: Sunset orange (#F78536)
   - Backgrounds: Soft white (#F9F9F9) and light grey (#F0F0F0)
   - Text: Dark grey (#333333) and medium grey (#666666)

2. **Typography**
   - Headings: Nunito (or similar rounded sans-serif)
   - Body: Inter (or similar clean sans-serif)
   - Create text styles for all necessary variations (H1-H6, Body, Caption, etc.)

3. **Component Library**
   - Design atomic components first:
     - Buttons (primary, secondary, text-only)
     - Input fields (text input, selection, date picker)
     - Cards (destination cards, itinerary cards)
     - Chat bubbles (AI agent, user)
     - Navigation elements (bottom tabs, headers)
     - Maps (container with example route)

## Screen Designs / 屏幕设计

Create the following screens based on the wireframes:

1. **Onboarding Flow**
   - Splash screen
   - Welcome screen
   - Optional brief tutorial screens

2. **Chat Interaction Screens**
   - Initial chat screen
   - Personality question screen
   - Emotion selection screen
   - Travel timing selection screen
   - Destination recommendations screen
   - Itinerary view screens with timeline components
   - Map view integration

3. **Archives Screens**
   - Archives list view
   - Archived trip detail view
   - Tagging/categorization interface

4. **Vision Board Screens**
   - Vision board grid layout
   - Add new inspiration interface
   - Vision board item detail view

## Interactive Prototype / 交互原型

Set up the following interactions:

1. **User Flows**
   - Onboarding to first chat
   - Complete user profiling sequence
   - Destination selection to itinerary view
   - Saving to archives flow
   - Archives browsing and filtering

2. **Micro-interactions**
   - Button state changes
   - Smooth transitions between screens
   - Chat message animations
   - Card selection feedback
   - Map interactions

3. **Advanced Prototyping**
   - Create smart animations for transitions
   - Set up variables for different user choices
   - Create conditional flows based on selections

## Best Practices / 最佳实践

- Use consistent spacing (8px grid system recommended)
- Maintain accessible color contrast (AA standard minimum)
- Design for both light and dark mode if possible
- Create responsive components that adapt to different phone sizes
- Add realistic content (travel destinations, itineraries, etc.) rather than lorem ipsum
- Document component variants and states

## Delivery Requirements / 交付要求

The final Figma deliverables should include:

1. Complete design system with documented components
2. All screens designed at standard mobile resolution (e.g., iPhone 13/14)
3. Interactive prototype demonstrating key user flows
4. Design documentation with rationale and guidelines
5. Exportable assets for development (icons, illustrations)

## Testing Recommendations / 测试建议

Before finalizing the design:

1. Conduct internal reviews for visual consistency
2. Test the prototype flow with potential users
3. Validate the emotional impact of the design (Does it feel calming? Supportive?)
4. Check accessibility with contrast checkers and screen readers
5. Ensure all interactive elements are properly sized for touch targets
