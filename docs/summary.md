## Conclusion / 结论

The WanderPal project aims to create an emotionally intelligent AI travel companion that helps users plan trips tailored to their personality and emotional state. The initial design work provides a solid foundation, focusing on a healing aesthetic and intuitive user experience.

The next critical step is to develop the Figma prototype based on our specifications, which will allow for user testing and validation of the concept before full-scale development begins.

WanderPal项目旨在创建一个情感智能的AI旅行伴侣，帮助用户规划根据其性格和情绪状态定制的旅行。初步设计工作提供了坚实的基础，注重疗愈美学和直观的用户体验。

下一个关键步骤是根据我们的规范开发Figma原型，这将允许在全面开发开始前进行用户测试和概念验证。
